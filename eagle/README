I've had a batch of these boards build at OSH Park and they work fine.
There's one minor issue. One mounting hole on the headphone/RCA jacks is a wee bit to small.
A little touch of the dremel on the pin and it fits in just fine.

Functionally I'm happy with this board and will use it as the basis for my
software developement.
