BeagleQ bbq controller based on the beaglebone black platform.

The goal here is to build a PID based BBQ controller that is fully web enabled.

I have workign hardware now and my attention will move towards the software. The 
plan is to do all the hardware interaction via the node web server.  All the pretty
pictures and forms will be done in JavaScript. The plan is to make this compatible
with smart devices such as iphone, ipads as well as standard desktop browsers.
